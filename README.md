# PMF_and_PDF_Application
Using the titanic dataset from seaborn, I demonstrate the difference between a Probability Mass Function and Probabilty Density Function.
I use the Probability Density Function to calculate the probability of surviving and of not surviving at different ages. This shows that the PDF is used for continuous random variable.
The Probabilty Mass Function is used to calculate the probabilty of surviving or not surviving in the titanic accident.Indicating that it's used to calculate the probability of a discrete random variable.
